"15. ""New Year's Day""

- The epilogue of ""reputation."" This song could be on any Swift album, and that's the point. Taylor tried a new persona, a darker one, on this album but she's still the girl she's always been. She's new yet nostalgic. A very pretty, sad song. A good goodbye.",,non-it,
"14. ""Call It What You Want""

- Okay, big finish. This is by far the best song on the album and quintessential Taylor. If ""reputation"" is all about trying to get people to really know and see the person Taylor is, this song is the exclamation point. A sweet and strong pop song.",,non-it,
"13. ""This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things""

- Not a fan. It's likely about Ye, and ok fine, whatever. Drama. But the song itself jumps up and down and is too goofy for me. Probably my least favorite song on the album.",,non-it,
"11. ""Dancing With Our Hands Tied""

- I like the chorus on this one. The more I listen to this album the more I hear an artist really trying to recover. Also, 11 tracks in and this track by track review is getting exhausting.",,non-it,
"10. ""King of My Heart""

- This song is really all over the place, so I'm kinda meh about it. Again, it's interesting to hear Tay talking about her end game when it comes to relationships. I don't know if she's sure when that'll be, but this song is hoping it's soon. So-so track.",,non-it,
"9. ""Getaway Car""

- Another fun one with a good hook. This might be about Tom Hiddleston, but who really knows? But it's another song about Tay trying to figure out on how to make initial, fantastical, and quite drunken love last forever. Hey Tay, if you figure that out, LMK.",,non-it,
"8. ""Gorgeous""

- Without a doubt, the most fun song on this whole album. It's playful, it's goofy, it's old school T. Swift. I also enjoy the dynamic of Taylor trying to fall in love, but accepting a life of stumbling home alone to her cats (again, been there). Fun all around.",,non-it,
"7. ""So It Goes...""

- Not a huge fan of this one. It's too dour. However, Tay conveying that she's ""not a bad girl, but does bad things"" is interesting to consider. The song itself is a bit weak for me despite its interesting questions about the artist singing it.",,non-it,
"6. ""Look What You Made Me Do""

- Hoo boy. Listen, this song isn't THAT bad, but it definitely has issues. It's grown on me, but it has the feel of an AIM profile written by someone who is reinventing themselves in high school. The video is better. Welp, another day, another drama",,non-it,
"5. ""Delicate""

- Tay understands that letting someone in requires them seeing you clearly. I think this album is about her realization that maybe no one really does right now. ""You must like me for me,"" but who are you? That's what this album is really about. Fun synthesized song",,non-it,
"4. ""Don't Blame Me""

- A reason I've always liked Tay is I believe she's in desperate need of love, but is so bad at getting/keeping it (been there). ""Blame Me"" compares love to a drug, and that's what it's been to her and probably what it'll always be. A good, but not great song",,non-it,
"3. ""I Did Something Bad""

- Dark Taylor in full effect, and I'm here for it. There's swearing, anger, and implication! Tay is scorching earth here and it's deserved. The line, ""This is how the world works. You gotta leave before you get left"" shows that Tay ain't a kid anymore.",SundayFutures,non-it,
