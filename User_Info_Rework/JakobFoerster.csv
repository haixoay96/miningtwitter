,,,,,,"@pczzy Did you replicate the network structure from the post? In particular did you take out all non-linearities? Are you training on GPU?"
,,,,,,"RT @y0b1byte: When you’ve tried everything, but it still doesn’t work, try this. Worked for me. https://t.co/zvuFXQKXE8"
,,,,,,"@pczzy Nice. Are you training on GPU and using evolution?"
